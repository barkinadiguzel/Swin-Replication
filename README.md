# Swin-Replication
Swin-Replication re-implements the core ideas of the Swin Transformer by using shifted window self-attention to capture both local patterns and cross-window interactions efficiently. This replication preserves the hierarchical design of the original model, allowing scalable feature extraction while keeping computation manageable.
